                                <p>
                                    Travel insurance, like other insurance products, is a contract between the insurer and the insured (or policyholder) where the insurer will compensate the policyholder for any loss related to an adverse event. For travel insurance, the policyholder is covered by the plan when he incurs losses while traveling either domestically or internationally.

                                    Medical emergencies can be a scary situation to be in especially if you’re overseas. The cost associated with a medical emergency can be significant so travel insurance can definitely be useful if you find yourself in this situation. Some plans may even cover the cost to let a family member or friend to visit the policyholder at the hospital. Losing your baggage when you travel is another huge inconvenience that no traveller should go through. For situations like these, your travel insurance may reimburse you for your loss so you have funds that you can use to pay for the things you need for your trip.

                                    If the worst were to happen, the family of the insured could receive benefits if the policyholder dies while he’s covered by the travel insurance. The insurer could provide assistance for repatriating the remains of the insured or they may also help with the cost for the overseas burial or cremation of the deceased.

                                    Take note though, that travel insurance commonly has provisions against dangerous activities like taking part in hazardous sports. There will also likely be provisions that say that the insurer will not cover the insured in the event of a war or similar circumstances. Like many insurance products, travel insurance also has standard provisions against suicide and self-harm.

                                    Having travel insurance helps you enjoy your vacation more because it frees you from thinking about the costs you could be burdened with if you get into one of these bad situations. Employers should also consider getting their employees travel insurance especially if they send their employees on official business trips overseas where regular health benefits may not provide coverage.
