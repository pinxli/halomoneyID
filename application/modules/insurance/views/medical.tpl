                                <h4>How to Choose the Right Medical Insurance</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The right health insurance can put your mind at ease, and allow you to have more money you can spend on other important things in your life. Here are a few things to consider in choosing the right medical insurance:

                                        <b>Know the different kinds of policies</b>
                                        <p>
                                            Do you want an insurance that provides support when you are diagnosed with certain illness, or one that gives you a certain amount in the event that you become disabled or injured? How about a plan that reimburses you for your medical expenses? Medical insurance are usually categorized into critical illness plan, disability income plan, and hospitalization and surgical (H&S) plan. You can choose which one you want or you can choose to include all three in your health insurance.

                                        <b>Set a budget</b>
                                        <p>
                                            How your medical policy insurance will cost will depend on factors including your age, health record, gender, and whether you smoke or not. It will also be largely affected by the medical coverage you want. Keep in mind that the more coverage you want for your insurance, the higher you will pay for the insurance fee.  
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <b>Choose higher age limit</b>
                                        <p>
                                            It would be wiser if you can choose higher age coverage. If there are two insurance policies to choose from, and one offers cover for up to 80 years, while the other offers one for up to 90 years, go with the 90 years' coverage plan. This, of course, will depend on how long you think you'll live up to be as well as your budget.

                                        <b>Avoid co-payments</b>
                                        <p>
                                            As much as possible, choose the insurance policy that has less fees to pay. One of the fees include co-payment charges. Co-payments simple means that apart from paying for room upgrades and other bills not covered by your health insurance, you also have to pay for interest rates. Therefore, try to choose the plan that does not include co-payments or one that has lower fees.

                                        <p>
                                            -   It is advisable that you pick the higher lifetime limit worth for your medical insurance so that you will have fewer worries in the future. Choose a lifetime limit of at least HK$ 1 million, to cover all your medical expenses and be able to live more comfortably.
