                                <p>
                                    The application process for savings accounts in Hong Kong is pretty straightforward. Typically, banks would only ask for an <b>ID</b> or <b>passport</b> and <b>proof of residence</b> in the territories or in your home country, if you do not live in Hong Kong. Even tourists can open a savings account straightaway, without having to submit a work visa or resident certificates. With some banks, you might have to provide a <b>social security number</b> if you are not a permanent Hong Kong resident.

                                    The bank will use the address you supply to post a <b>letter</b>, which, upon receipt, you must take to the bank to open your savings account. Best remember that some banks are still more stringent when it comes to the documents required but for most major banks like <b>HSBC</b>, <b>Hang Seng</b>, and <b>Standard Chartered</b>, applications are rather fuss-free, even for non-Hong Kong residents.
