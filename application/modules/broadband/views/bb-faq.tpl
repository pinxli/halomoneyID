			<h2>Credit card FAQ</h2>
			<p>This is a general credit cards Hong Kong FAQ page. If you were looking for our website's FAQs, please visit the <a href="{$baseUrl}credit-card/faq">Moneyhero FAQ page</a>.</p>
			<h2>
				How long does it take to process my credit card application?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The processing time varies depending on the card issuer, but as soon as your application has been approved, it normally takes 7 to 10 working days until
				you receive your card. Make sure that you submit all the relevant documents so that your application can be processed as quickly as possible.
			</p>
			<h2>
				When do I have to pay my credit card bill?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Different types of credit cards have different due dates. The payment due date for a specific billing period is usually indicated in your credit card
				statement. However, you should call your bank and speak to them directly to verify the payment date.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Who is eligible to apply for a credit card in Malaysia?
			</h2>

			<p>
				In order to be eligible for a credit card in Malaysia, you need to be at least 21 years old and financially stable. Each credit card issuer has its own
				minimum annual income requirement. In most cases, a minimum annual income of RM18,000 is required, but this could vary from bank to bank. You don't need to
				have an existing account with a bank to apply for a credit card from them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember to always <a href="{$baseUrl}credit-card">research the best credit cards</a> before applying!
			</p>
			<h2>
				Joint cards: Who is responsible for paying dues and payments?
			</h2>

			<p>
				The primary cardholder is responsible for dues and payments. In the event that a supplementary card is misused by a family member or an individual you have
				named as holder of a supplementary card, you, as the primary card holder, will be liable to pay any outstanding payments or dues. If you feel that a
				supplementary card is being misused, you should consult your bank and consider having the card cancelled.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Are there any hidden credit card fees?
			</h2>
			<p>
				There should not be any hidden fees. All credit card providers in Malaysia are required by law to provide their customers with a Product Disclosure Sheet.
				However, it is highly important that you carefully read through the terms and conditions governing your credit card. Common fees include annual,
				application, and late payment fees.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a list of fees and other important financial terminology, visit our <a href="{$baseUrl}credit-card/glossary">credit cards glossary</a>
				page.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Which documents are needed to apply for a credit card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Here are the documents you need to submit together with your completed application form:
			</p>
			<p>
				For employees:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						A photocopy of your MyKad or, for non-Malaysians, your passport.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Your most recent Form B and tax payment slip, your salary slip from the last 2 months, or your most recent EPF statement.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For self-employed workers:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						A photocopy of your MyKad or, for non-Malaysians, your passport.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Your Business Registration Certificate.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				How can I apply for a supplementary card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				In the same manner you apply for a primary card: you may download the application form online and mail it to the credit card issuer. Alternatively, you may
				visit your nearest branch and apply for a supplementary card over the counter. Do remember that a supplementary cardholder has to be at least 18 years old.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I activate my credit card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Information on how to activate your credit card will be sent to you with your new card. Activation is usually done over the phone or the internet. Some
				issuers also let you activate via SMS.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What happens if I don't activate my credit card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				You will not be able to use your credit card unless you activate it. However, you will not be penalised if you don't activate your credit card.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What is the minimum amount I need to pay each month?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The minimum amount payable is calculated based on your outstanding balance, and will be shown on your monthly statement. However, only paying the minimum
				is not advisable, as the amount of interest you have to pay back will snowball, and only a very small portion of the amount you pay each month will
				actually go to paying off the principal debt. Work on your budget, and if you can afford it, pay more than the minimum each month. You will be surprised at
				how much difference that extra RM100 each month can make.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more information on budgeting, read our handy blog post on how to manage your money.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How much is my credit limit?
			</h2>
			<p>
				If you're earning an annual income of RM36,000 or less, the maximum limit extended to you will not exceed twice your monthly income for every credit card
				issuer. This guideline does not apply if you are earning more than RM36,000 per annum, so you should consult your credit card issuer in Malaysia to find
				out how much your credit limit will be. Your credit limit can also be raised if you show good repayment behaviour. You can talk to your credit card issuer
				about raising your credit limit.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How many credit cards can I apply for?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Depending on your credit score, you may be able to hold multiple credit cards. However, the number of credit cards you have and your repayment behaviour
				will affect your credit score. In 2011, Bank Negara Malaysia introduced a guideline stating that anyone with an annual income of RM36,000 or less can hold
				credit cards from a maximum of two issuers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Focus on choosing one or two credit cards which suit you and your requirements best. Eventually, if you prove your good repayment behaviour, you will be
				offered a higher credit limit.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I update my credit card details?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Usually, you will be required to fill out the relevant form from your credit card provider in order to update your details. You can access these forms
				online or request them from your credit card issuer via email or phone.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What if my credit card is lost or stolen?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Contact your bank immediately, so they can put security measures in place if any purchases or fraudulent transactions show up later on your account. You
				may be charged a card replacement fee and your provider will send you a new card and cancel your old one.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What if I notice something suspicious on my credit card activity?
			</h2>

			<p>
				If you suspect an unauthorised transaction has been made on your account, check if you made any other purchases on the same day before contacting your
				bank. The item could have been mistakenly billed under a different name. Also, ask anyone who uses the card with your permission (such as your partner) if
				they made the purchase.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have confirmed that the transaction was unauthorised, contact your credit card issuer immediately. Credit card issuers provide 24/7 customer
				service to address these matters, so do not hesitate to take immediate action. Failure to do so could make you liable for the unauthorised transactions
				charged to your credit card.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<h2>
				What are CVC and CSC?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Credit cards include a security feature known as the Card Verification Code (CVC) or Card Security Code (CSC). These codes are used for verification
				purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				For MasterCard and Visa credit cards, this code is a 3-digit number found on the back of the card, on the right-hand side of the signature strip.
			</p>
			<p>
				For American Express cards, this code is a 4-digit number located on the front of the card, on the right-hand side.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What is 3D secure?
			</h2>

			<p>
				3D secure is an extra layer of security for online transactions. You will be requested to enter a Transaction Authorisation Code (TAC) or a One Time PIN
				(OTP) when shopping online to verify your identity.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What should I do if I forget my credit card PIN?
			</h2>

			<p>
				If you forget your PIN, contact your credit card issuer and request a new one. Never write your PIN down and don't tell anyone about it. Your PIN code is
				extremely important. If someone else gets hold of this information, they could use your credit card to withdraw money from an ATM machine.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I get a replacement card?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Whether your card is damaged or lost, the first step is to notify your credit card issuer. You may be charged a card replacement fee and then the new card
				will be mailed to you. Once you have received your new card, activate it, and cut up your old card to prevent any potential misuse.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Why was I charged interest on my purchase even though I made the payment?
			</h2>

			<p>
				This situation occurs when you have an outstanding amount not settled for balance transfer. The payment you made usually reduces the balances charged at a
				lower interest rate first. You are advised to fully settle your balance transfer before making any new purchases. Alternatively, you may use another credit
				card with a lower interest rate to make your purchases.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What is a secured credit card?
			</h2>

			<p>
				A secured credit card requires you to put down a deposit for the credit card. Secured credit cards are a great way to build or improve your credit score.
				Secured credit cards usually come with higher interest rates and other fees.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How many supplementary cards can I apply for?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Depending on your credit card issuer, each principal card may apply for around three supplementary cards. Consult your credit card provider in Malaysia to
				find out more.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I set a credit limit for a supplementary card?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Yes, you may set a credit limit for supplementary cards connected to your principal card. The maximum combined credit limit allowed is the credit limit of
				your principal credit card.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I withdraw cash overseas?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Yes, you may use the cash withdrawal service overseas. You can withdraw cash at any ATM worldwide which accepts Visa or MasterCard. However, check to see
				if there are any fees for such transactions and bear in mind that you may not get the best conversion rates if you withdraw another currency.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How to cancel my credit card?
			</h2>

				<p>
					Before cancelling a credit card, make sure that you have fully settled the remaining balance. Contact the credit card issuer and let them know you
					intend to cancel the card. Make sure that you receive written confirmation from the credit card issuer regarding the cancellation of the card; this is
					important in case any issues arise in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Be aware that cancelling a credit card can influence your credit score. Just because you don't have a credit card anymore doesn't mean you won't have a
					credit score either. Instead, you may get a lower credit rating. This is because not having a credit card could show that you are less likely to take
					out another loan or credit card - making it harder for banks to make a profit out of you - or it might indicate that you are not able to maintain
					repayments.
