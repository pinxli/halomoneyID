			<h1>Everything you need to know about credit cards in Malaysia</h1>
			<p>
				Credit cards offer a quick and easy way to buy that car, those trainers, or even that long-haul flight to Europe - but you should always keep in mind that
				anything you buy using a credit card is bought 'on credit.' This means that you buy now but pay later, and if you aren't able to pay later, then you may
				find yourself in debt pretty quickly.
			</p>
			<p>
				When used correctly, however, credit cards offer a huge range of advantages, including rebates and rewards points. Here's our guide on everything you need
				to know about credit cards in Malaysia. It will show you how to find the best credit card and take advantage of all of its different benefits.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do credit cards work?
			</h2>
			<p>
				A credit card is essentially a type of loan, which means that whenever you buy something using your credit card, you're borrowing the money to pay for it
				from your credit card provider. Before you get a credit card, your bank or lender will review your credit history and decide on your credit limit and what
				the terms of repayment will be.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your credit history is a record of all of the credit you have used in the past - including loans, credit cards, overdrafts, et al - as well as other
				information, such as whether you pay your internet or phone bill on time or not. If you have a good credit history, the lender will usually offer you a
				higher credit limit and lower interest. For more information about credit scores and how to improve yours, read our guide to everything you need to know
				about your credit score.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of each month, you will receive a bill from your credit card provider which shows how much you owe and what you spent it on. It will also state
				the deadline for payment and the minimum payment you have to make.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I know how much I can spend using my credit card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				If your application for a credit card is approved, your provider will draw up all the different details of your account, including your credit limit. Your
				credit limit restricts the maximum amount you can spend on the card or, in other words, how much you can borrow from the lender. Regulations set by Bank
				Negara Malaysia state that for cardholders earning less than RM3,000 per month, the maximum credit limit extended to them shall not exceed two times their
				monthly income per card.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What about credit card interest?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Credit card interest is shown as Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on advertisements. APR is the total cost of credit, shown as a percentage. It includes fees
				and interest. Comparing the APR of different credit cards in Malaysia is a convenient way for applicants to compare the wide range of personal loans
				available on the market. Interest rates for credit cards vary widely, from around 8% to around 15%. Interest can be charged on retail purchases, balance
				transfers and cash withdrawals. Usually, different rates are charged for each category, with balance transfers having a lower rate and cash withdrawals
				having a higher rate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note: interest rates for credit cards are mostly charged on a variable interest rate, which means that your interest rate might change with little to no
				notice. Go through your monthly statement to keep track of the interest rate charged on your credit cards.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How much interest will be charged on my credit card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The interest rate charged for credit cards in Malaysia varies for each individual. You will usually be able to get a lower interest rate if you have a good
				credit score. With credit cards, interest is charged on the outstanding balance, so it is best to pay off the full amount at the end of each month. If this
				is not possible, try to avoid just paying the minimum. If you pay just the minimum, the amount of interest you have to pay will snowball and it will take
				you much longer to pay off your debt completely.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I lower my credit card interest rate?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Depending on your repayment behaviour, you credit card interest rate might be adjusted by your credit card provider. This is known as a tiered interest
				rate, which means that the better your repayment behaviour, the lower the interest rate will be. This policy was introduced by Bank Negara Malaysia in 2007
				(external link, no follow,    <a href="http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=8&amp;pg=14&amp;ac=1467">http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=8&amp;pg=14&amp;ac=1467</a>) to encourage prompt
				payment. To enjoy a lower interest rate, you are encouraged to pay off your outstanding balance in full or, at the very least, make the minimum payment by
				the monthly payment due date for a consecutive 12 months. If you are unable to do so, make sure you try to be prompt with your payments for at least 10 to
				11 months per year.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Are there instances when I am not charged interest?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Most credit cards will offer you the benefit of a 20-day interest free period. This grace period is usually applicable to all retail purchases, and will
				only be extended if you are able to pay in full on or before the monthly payment due date.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Are there credit cards with no interest?
			</h2>
			<p>
				A lot of credit card providers offer zero-interest cards -- they have a set period of 0% interest, which means that you will be able to enjoy a loan with
				no interest, as long as you are able to pay it back within the grace period.

			</p>
			<h2>
				What is a prepaid card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				A prepaid card is a card that can be used to make purchases like any other credit card in Malaysia; however, you can only spend what you already have
				stored on the card. The biggest advantage of getting a prepaid card is that there is no income requirement or age limit (for most prepaid cards); therefore
				it can be a safe and convenient payment method for teenagers or if you are travelling.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What is a charge card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Charge cards are similar to credit cards, as you are able to make purchases using credit. The difference between a credit card and a charge card is that a
				charge card requires you repay what you owe in full month, and there is no pre-set limit. American Express is the biggest provider of charge cards in the
				world.
			</p>
			<p>
				With a standard credit card, you will not be charged a late payment fee as long as you pay the minimum amount each month. With a charge card, however, you
				are required to repay in full each month, otherwise you will incur a late payment fee.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What is a supplementary card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				As the principal cardholder, you may nominate a third party to get a credit card and enjoy the same privileges extended to you. There is no income
				requirement to be a supplementary cardholder. However, supplementary cardholders need to be at least 18 years old. Any transaction made will count towards
				the principal account.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What is a secured credit card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				A secured credit card requires you to put down a deposit, or security sum, for the credit card. Secured credit cards are a good option if you want to build
				or improve your credit score. Taking a deposit for the credit card is a way for the issuer to ensure that your debt will be covered. You are still required
				to make your monthly payment and your deposit is only used as a backup to pay for extra charges. Secured credit cards usually come with higher interest
				rates and other fees. With good repayment behaviour , your credit score can improve rapidly if you use secured credit cards, so you may want to change to a
				standard credit card afterwards.

			<h2>
				Who is eligible to apply for a credit card in Malaysia?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Go through the checklist below to find out if you are eligible to apply for a credit card.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Income:
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				From 2011 onwards, Bank Negara Malaysia (external link to    <a href="http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=8&amp;pg=14&amp;ac=2226">http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=8&amp;pg=14&amp;ac=2226</a>) decreed that a minimum
				monthly income of RM2,000 is required to apply for a credit card. Credit cards with higher credit limits require higher minimum monthly incomes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong id="docs-internal-guid-6702b6b9-e4ac-86c3-723d-2641a181cc80">
					<br>
				</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Age:
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The minimum age required to apply for a credit card is 21, while people who are at least 18 years of age are eligible to apply for a supplementary card.
				Some credit cards require a higher minimum age due to their more privileged nature.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What are the fees and charges on my credit card?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Interest is not the only additional fee you pay with credit cards, so it is important that you are aware of all the charges and fees you may have to pay.
				If you don't know about them, they could increase your debt, and in turn increase your monthly interest as well. Remember to check if there are any
				exemptions available for these fees before applying for a credit card. However, while some credit cards will advertise a 'RM0 annual fee' or '0% balance
				transfer,' do note that most of these benefits will not last forever, so consider the fine print of your contract and make sure you know what is coming.
				Other fees and charges you can expect on your credit card include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Annual fee
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Balance transfer fee
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Card replacement fee
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Cash advance fee
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Overseas transaction fee and currency conversion
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Late payment fee
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Over limit fee
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Service tax
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Statement charge
					</p>
				</li>

						Supplementary card annual fee
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>

				Before making any purchases or subscribing to any services, be aware that some companies have 'grey' charges hidden in the fine print. For example, you may
				sign up for a free trial of a service, and they may automatically convert you to a paid subscription at the end of trial. Some online services also have
				hidden costs and you may end up having to pay for additional services that you wouldn't have wanted otherwise. Finding the best credit cards available
				requires that you're keen on the details to avoid these grey charges.

				of the features and benefits that credit cards in Malaysia offer. Choose your own requirements from this list and head over to our    <a href="http://www.moneyhero.com.hk/credit-card">credit card comparison page</a> to see which credit card offers you the benefits you're looking for.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Balance transfer
			</h2>
			<p>
				The balance transfer service allows you to consolidate your debt from a few credit cards into just one. You pay a percentage of your outstanding balance as
				a balance transfer fee and enjoy an interest rate as low as 0%. You need to settle your debt by a fixed period of time, which usually varies from 12 to 36
				months.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Business credit cards
			</h2>
			<p>
				Business credit cards have benefits relevant for businesses; these may include air miles for business trips, cashback, and so on. Some business credit
				cards also provide financial tools to keep track of your credit card spending.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Low interest credit cards
			</h2>
			<p>
				Some credit cards offer interest rates as low as 8.88% (APR). This is a lot lower than the 15% stipulated by Bank Negara Malaysia.
			</p>
			<h2>
				No annual fee credit cards
			</h2>
			<p>
				Many credit cards now offer no annual fee for life! Make sure you read the fine print carefully though, as there might be some strings attached: some might
				just be free for one year, and some may require you to spend a minimum amount per year before you are able to qualify for the RM0 annual fee.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Frequent traveller benefits
			</h2>
			<p>
				Credit cards with traveller benefits offer you many deals, ranging from flight tickets to shopping privileges worldwide. Travel rewards often include air
				miles, free travel insurance and access to airport lounges worldwide, as well as shopping and dining privileges worldwide.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Rewards - reward points, cashback, and discounts
			</h2>
			<p>
				Many credit cards offer rewards in the form of reward points, cashback rebates and retail perks for shopping, dining, and entertainment. These can be great
				money saving tools if used well and you can enjoy cashbacks and discounts at selected retail partners.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Premium privileges
			</h2>
			<p>
				Premium privileges are offered to 'exclusive' cardholders, often platinum cardholders. Premium privileges include access to exclusive airport lounges
				worldwide, 24-hour concierge service, premium health benefits, dining perks, and worldwide travel assistance.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Petrol rewards
			</h2>
			<p>
				Petrol rewards allow you to receive cashbacks on the money you spend on petrol. You may also receive points which you can exchange for petrol vouchers, or
				free petrol vouchers when you sign up. Check the fine print though: some cards offer rebate on all petrol purchases, while others only offer rebates when
				you buy from a certain brand.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Islamic banking credit cards
			</h2>
			<p>
				Islamic credit cards in Malaysia are compliant with Sharia Law. Islamic credit cards often include cashbacks, reward points, and other rewards as well.
				They may also include free Takaful insurance.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Credit cards for instalments
			</h2>
			<p>
				Flexi-Pay is a good option when you want to pay for a large purchase and do not have sufficient cash available at the time. Flexi-Pay lets you pay in
				instalments with a very low or 0% interest rate.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Credit cards for balance transfer
			</h2>
			<p>
				Most credit cards in Malaysia offer a balance transfer service to cardholders. Balance transfer can be a good option if you are on a tight budget due to
				multiple credit cards payments every month, as this service allows you to transfer your debt to a single credit card account.
			</p>
			<p>
				Balance transfer is a form of debt consolidation. It means using one credit card to pay off other debts; most of the time other credit card debts. For the
				balance transfer service, you need to pay a small percentage of the outstanding balance as a balance transfer fee, and interest can still be charged on
				your outstanding balance every month. You also need to settle your debt within a set period of time - usually between 12 to 36 months.
			</p>
			<p>
				While many credit cards advertise a 0% interest rate for balance transfer, remember that this benefit may only last for a certain amount of time - always
				check the terms and conditions to find out exactly how it works.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Credit cards for cash withdrawals
			</h2>
			<p>
				You may use your credit card to withdraw cash. Simply go to one of your credit card issuer's ATMs and withdraw the desired amount. There is also a daily
				limit on how much you can withdraw using your credit card; for many cards, this is set at RM5,000. It is, however, better to avoid withdrawing money using
				your credit card wherever possible, as you will often be charged a cash withdrawal fee and a high interest rate afterwards.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What is a credit card PIN code?
			</h2>
			<p>
				PIN stands for personal identification number, and you need your credit card PIN to withdraw cash. Sometimes you may also be asked to enter your PIN in
				shops, especially in certain countries, but your PIN is not used for online, mail, or phone transactions. Make sure you memorise your PIN and don't share
				it with anyone.
