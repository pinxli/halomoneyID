                                <h4>Broadband Internet Indonesia</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Almost 5 million people,  or roughly 70% of Indonesiaâ€™s population, are internet users. Citizens and newly arrived expats can easily apply for an internet subscription from the a handful of internet service providers (ISP) in the territory, the biggest of which is PCCW. To see a complete list of ISPs in Indonesia, visit our general <u>guide to broadband plans</u>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Indonesia broadband is known for being among the </u>fastest in the world</u>, even faster than in the US and European countries. And unlike in the West, connection fees are relatively less costly. Internet service companies in the territory make use of high-technology infrastructure, including fibre-optic internet facilities that can deliver up to 1Gbps broadband connection. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The government has launched an initiative to offer free internet to everybody and turn Indonesia into a wireless city. Public internet access known as GovWiFi is available almost anywhere including coffee shops, hotels, airports, libraries, and even buses and ferries
                                </p>
                                <h4>Best Broadband Plans in Indonesia</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The first step to determining the best broadband plan for you is to assess your needs and your internet usage patterns. If you are going to need the internet for business purposes, then you need a steady and reliable connection, for whish you will possibly have to pay more. If you are applying for a broadband connection for your residence, but are rarely at home, then an unlimited plan might not be right for you.  
                                </p>
                                <h4>Bandwidth and data limits</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Everytime you use the internet, data is transferred to and from your computer and the WorldWide Web. When choosing among broadband plans, you will notice different bandwidth limits on different plans. Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data (capacity) that can be transferred at a specific period of time, say, monthly. Data transfer is the actual amount of data transferred. You know you are getting a good deal if the gap between your bandwidth limit and actual usage is not too broad.  
                                </p>
                                <h4>Internet coverage</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Indonesia residents may not only enjoy free internet anywhere in the city, they can also avail of their own private connection at affordable fees.  Before you apply for the cheapest plan, make sure that your chosen provider provides the type of internet coverage in your residential area.  
                                </p>
                                <h4>Contract period</h4>
                                <p>
                                    When you get an internet subscription, you would be signing a contract with your ISP for a specific period of time. This means you would have to pay a fee if you cancel your subscription within the agreed time period, usually a minimum of one year. Good news though is that in Indonesia, broadband plans are transferrable to another user, for a fee. 
                                </p>
                                <h4>Tariffs and PNETS</h4>
                                <p>
                                    There are typically two types of tariffs on internet subscribers in Indonesia. With some ISPs, customers may avail of a plan that combines both options, which are:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <b><i>Monthly standard rates.</b></i> A fixed monthly tariff is imposed on plans that offer unlimited internet access to subscribers.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b><i>Charge according to usage.</b></i> This is the type of <b>broadband plan</b> charges the customer according to how much data was transferred online and the amount of time spent online. 
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    <b>PNETS</b> or Public Non-Exclusive Telecommunications Service charge is applicable to internet users gaining access through a narrow-band dial-up modem or telephone lines. PNETS is an inter-connection charge that is separate from your standard internet fees. 
                                </p>
