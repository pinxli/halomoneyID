			<h2>香港信用卡指引</h2>
			<h2 class="item-headers">什麽是信用卡？</h2>
			<p>
				香港的信用卡和其他國家的用法差不多，由銀行如匯豐銀行或消費金融公司如AEON信貸財務（香港）發出。消費者使用信用卡以信貸或現金預付的方式購買產品和付服務費用。發行者通常會設上限於每月信用卡消費，稱爲信用額度，按照持卡人每月收入而設定。
			</p>
			<h2 class="item-headers">信用卡是怎麽運作的？</h2>
			<p>
				我們由香港金融管理局的資料中整理出一個基本的圖解去解釋當你用信用卡購買產品服務時的交易運作，如下：

			</p>
			<p>
				信用卡買賣中的主要各方是： 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>持卡人：</strong>任何使用信用卡付款的獲授權人士（包括子女和妻子的附屬卡持有人）
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>發卡人: </strong>發出信用卡的機構。主要的發卡人包括銀行和消費金融公司  
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>C信用卡機構：</strong>發出牌照給發卡機構，作爲發卡人和收單機構的接單中介機構。Visa 卡、萬事達卡、中國銀聯卡和日本株式会社是在香港中活躍運作的國際信用卡機構。
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>收單機構：</strong>為商戶處理信用卡交易的機構，通常是本地銀行。他們為商戶提供自動化和核准信用卡交易的銷售終端機。 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>商戶：</strong>售賣產品或提供服務時接受信用卡為付款方法。全球上百萬的零售商都接受信用卡，令信用卡成爲一個非常方便的付款方法。
			</p>
			<p>
				在香港，大多數主要的零售商和食肆接受信用卡。現金優惠或信用卡附加費在小的店鋪和餐廳也是挺常見的。在盡情購物時，你最好查清楚有沒有附加的信用卡收費。
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>香港主要的信用卡有哪幾種？</u>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>一般用途本地貨幣信用卡：</strong>這些是一般由銀行發出、讓你以港幣付款的信用卡。這些卡通常按照持卡人的收入階層分爲白金、金或是標準卡。你也可以要求銀行發出附屬卡給你的親人，例如是你的伴侶或子女。注意用這些卡交易時，以外幣計價的都會被轉換成港幣計價。發卡者一般都會在外匯買賣價格的差額之上再收取交易費（通常是交易額的1%-2%）如果你是用這一種信用卡的話，你可能要在網上購物或用外幣付款時額外留意所收取的外匯交易費。
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>一般用途多貨幣/外幣信用卡：</strong>這些信用卡類似本地貨幣的信用卡但提供了以其他特定外幣付款時免除額外外匯費用的便利。這一類的信用卡越來越受歡迎，尤其是在一個全球商業樞紐像香港。例如很多發卡者在香港都提供中國銀聯雙貨幣（港幣和人民幣）信用卡，很受常到訪中國的商務和休閒旅客的歡迎。	
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>聯合品牌信用卡：</strong>一些商戶和非牟利機構（例如專業團體或已註冊慈善機構）會與發卡機構（例如銀行或消費金融公司）發行有他們的名稱和標誌的一般用途信用卡。這些卡是稱作為聯合品牌卡。發卡機構（例如匯豐）通常會補償商戶或非牟利機構 
						</p>

						<p>
							The names of the card issuer (e.g. HSBC or Citibank) and the credit card organisation (e.g. Visa) are usually printed on the affinity cards.  Affinity or Co-Branded Credit Cards, just like general-purpose credit cards, are widely accepted globally as it is supported by the credit card organisation’s network (e.g. the global merchant network of Visa or Mastercard).
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Private Label (Store) Credit Cards: </strong>Sometimes, banks might work with large merchants (usually large department stores or retail chains like Harvey Nichols) to directly issue <strong>private label credit cards</strong>. Cardholders usually enjoy exclusive deals from the partnering merchants.  Note that these cards usually do not carry a credit card organisation logo like Visa logo. Private label credit cards are not usually widely accepted and you are usually restricted to use the credit card in stores that associated with the issuing merchants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<u><i>What are Cash Back Rebates and Loyalty / Reward Points?</i></u> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most credit card issuers offer some incentives to attract and reward loyal cardholders. Two of the more popular incentives are <strong>cash back rebates</strong> and <strong>loyalty points</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cash Back Rebates: </strong>Every time you spend with your credit card, you will be eligible for a predetermined rebate amount on your transaction. After a period of time, usually a year, the accumulated rebate amount will be credited to your credit card account.  The cash back rate is generally around 1% to 2% but a wide range of cash rebate terms will apply. For example, cash rebates may be tiered by spending categories i.e. higher rebates on dining spending than retail spending. Alternatively the cash back rates might be tiered based on cumulative spending over a certain time period. There are even issuers that offer higher cash rebates on overseas and online spending. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Please refer to our table that provides a summary comparison of all the cash rebate terms in order to select the best option based on your spending habits and needs
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Loyalty / Reward Points: </strong>The loyalty scheme is similar to cash back rebate except that you are rewarded with loyalty/reward points instead of a cash rebate. Depending on the card issuer, the loyalty/reward points can be redeemed either as frequent flier miles or gifts (e.g. consumer electronics goods).  Note that different card issuers have varying terms when it comes to redeeming your loyalty/reward points. Some card issuers allow accrued loyalty/reward points to be carried forward indefinitely and others have an expiry period after which unredeemed points are forfeited. 
			</p>

				Please check our comparison table for a quick summary and details of the incentives offered by the card issuers.

				<i><u>What are the important things that I need to keep in mind when choosing and using a credit card?</u></i>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) and Monthly Interest Charges: </strong>Credit Card Issuers usually use APRs, which might take into account both interest rates and other charges, to calculate your monthly interest charge. An interest charge calculation for a credit card transaction might be as follows: 
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Value of Credit Card Transaction X Daily Percentage Rate X Number of Days
							where Daily Percentage Rate is APR divided by 365 or 366</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							APR is the best reflection of your cost of borrowing using a credit card. APR is a useful tool to compare personal loan and credit card offers. The average APR for credit cards in Hong Kong is around 35%; however, your actual APR will depend on your creditworthiness. Cardholders with better credit scores and payment histories will be eligible for lower APRs. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Make the best use of the Interest Free Period: </strong>Payment for credit card purchases of goods and services are normally due after a free credit period. As long you pay your credit card balance in full before or on the payment due date, no interest or finance charge will be imposed. Savvy consumers benefit from wisely using this free short-term credit offered by credit cards. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that if you have any unpaid balances from the previous month, you will not be eligible for the interest free period.  Further, any <strong>cash advances using credit cards have no interest free period</strong> and interest is charged from the date of the withdrawal. So, make sure you use your credit card to withdraw cash only in emergencies. The interest free period offered varies by credit card issuers. Use our comparison table to identify the longest interest free period that is available.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Understand all the Fees: </strong>Please read the fine print in the application form to understand all the additional charges and fees associated with the credit card. Some of the fees that you might want to check on include annual fees to maintain the credit card account, late payment charges, charges and fees for exceeding the credit limit and for handling foreign currency transactions, and handling fees for cash advances or returning purchased goods. The credit card market in Hong Kong is highly competitive and most issuers offer promotional waivers on fees and charges. Please look up the most competitive offers in our comparison page and don’t forget to sign up for our newsletter for future alerts.  
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Supporting your Spending Habits & Lifestyle Needs: </strong>You need to find the right credit card that fits your spending habits and lifestyle needs. Lowest fees and competitive APRs are not the sole criteria in your decision.  For example, if you are a frequent business traveler, you might be interested in getting an airline affinity credit card that might offer additional benefits like free airport limousine transfer services, complimentary travel insurance or access to exclusive airport travel lounges.
